# SF Demo Scout 🦮

**Your AI-powered demo prep sidekick** — because nobody became an SE to manually configure permission sets.

SF Demo Scout turns customer discovery notes into fully configured Salesforce demo orgs. You talk about the customer, Scout handles the clicks. Think of it as a Trailblazer who actually *reads* the release notes.

## What You Need

| Ingredient | Why |
|------------|-----|
| macOS | Apple Silicon or Intel. Sorry, Windows friends. 🍎 |
| AWS Bedrock access | Claude Opus thinks. Claude Sonnet builds. Bedrock hosts the party. |
| A Salesforce demo org | SDO, IDO, personal dev org — we're not picky. The messier, the more fun. |

---

## Install (One Time, We Promise)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seb-schi/sf-demo-scout ~/Projects/sf-demo-scout
cd ~/Projects/sf-demo-scout && bash install.sh
```

Go grab a coffee. ☕ The script installs Homebrew, Node.js, Python, Salesforce CLI, Claude Code itself, sets up the SFDX project, pulls 13 community skills from three open-source repos, and wires your Bedrock environment. It's idempotent — re-run it whenever your Mac gives you trust issues.

Then: **VS Code → Open Folder → `~/Projects/sf-demo-scout` → Open Terminal → `claude` → `/setup-demo-scout`**

That's it. You're in.

## Updating

```bash
bash update.sh
```

No `git pull` drama here. Scout nukes the install, re-clones fresh, and restores your org data (audits, specs, change logs). Clean slate. Zero drift. ~30 seconds. Like a metadata refresh, but for your tooling.

> 💡 Running from VS Code? It'll pop open Terminal.app for you. Close VS Code, let it cook, reopen after.

## How It Works

Two commands. That's the whole workflow.

| Step | Command | What happens |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Spar** | `/scout-sparring` | You share customer context. Opus audits the org, researches platform capabilities, asks smart questions, and produces a structured demo spec. |
| **Build** | `/scout-building` | Opus reads the spec, orchestrates Sonnet sub-agents across three phases (org config → flows/apex/LWC → Agentforce), and writes a change log. |

Always spar first. Always build second. It's like discovery → demo, but for configuring the demo itself. Very meta. 🤯

### Supporting Cast

| Command | When to use it |
|---------|---------------|
| `/setup-demo-scout` | First time connecting an org |
| `/switch-org` | Switching to a different demo org |
| `/sync-skills` | Pulling latest community skills (install does this too) |

---

## What Scout Can Do

### Fully autonomous (no approvals needed)
Custom objects, fields, picklist values, record types, queues, permission sets, page layout field additions, Lightning apps & tabs, and demo data seeding. Scout does these in its sleep. If it had sleep.

### One-time SE confirmation per category
Record-triggered Flows, simple Apex, simple LWC, and Agentforce agents (with smoke testing!). Confirm once, Scout handles the rest.

### Still on your plate (for now 😉)
Screen flows, scheduled flows, complex Apex/LWC, multi-agent orchestration, page layout visual arrangement, reports, dashboards, OmniStudio. Scout adds these to a Manual Checklist so you don't forget.

---

## What You Get Back

After every run, Scout saves artifacts in `orgs/[alias]-[customer]/`:

| File | What's inside |
|------|---------------|
| `audit-*.md` | Org snapshot — objects, flows, agents, layouts, gaps |
| `demo-spec-*.md` | The deployment spec (your source of truth) |
| `changes-*.md` | What got deployed, what to verify, what's on you |

These survive updates. They're *your* data — Scout just writes them.

## The Salesforce Connection

Scout talks to your org through two MCP servers:

🔧 **Salesforce DX MCP** — metadata deployment, SOQL queries, permission sets, code analysis, LWC scaffolding. The workhorse.

📚 **Salesforce Docs MCP** — semantic search across official Salesforce docs. Scout checks release notes and dev guides so you don't have to. Optional — degrades gracefully if unavailable.

Falls back to `sf` CLI when MCP acts up. Belt and suspenders.

---

## Skills & Smarts

Scout's intelligence lives in **skills** — domain-specific instruction sets loaded on demand. They're why Scout knows Flow XML needs `<start><filters>` and not `processMetadataValues`, why it never sets `TabVisibility: DefaultOn`, and why it checks `EntityDefinition` flags before suggesting a trigger.

**Ships with the repo** (3 demo skills):
- `demo-deployment-rules` — the rulebook for deploying Flows, Apex, LWC, Agentforce
- `demo-org-audit` — how to audit an org properly
- `demo-docs-consultation` — when to look things up vs. wing it

**Downloaded at install** (13 community skills):
- 7 from [Jaganpro/sf-skills](https://github.com/Jaganpro/sf-skills) — SOQL, Apex, Flows, Permissions, Deploy, Data, Debug
- 3 from [forcedotcom/afv-library](https://github.com/forcedotcom/afv-library) — Custom Fields, Objects, Permission Sets
- 3 from [SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc) — Agentforce dev, test, observe

Manage skills declaratively: edit `.claude/skills-manifest.yaml` → run `/sync-skills`. Done.

## FAQ (Frequently Anticipated Questions)

**Q: Can I use this with a sandbox?**
A: Yes! Any org that `sf org login web` can authenticate. SDO, IDO, sandbox, dev org — Scout doesn't judge.

**Q: What if I mess up my org?**
A: Every change log includes rollback commands. Scout's like a responsible designated driver — it notes the way back.

**Q: What model does it use?**
A: Opus for thinking (sparring, orchestration), Sonnet for doing (metadata generation, deployment). Both on Bedrock.

**Q: Can I use it without Agentforce?**
A: Absolutely. Agentforce is Phase 3 — if your spec doesn't include agents, that phase simply doesn't run.
