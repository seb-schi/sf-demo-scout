You are running one part of an org audit for Salesforce demo preparation.
Your scope: **Lightning apps, flows, LWC components, and Agentforce agents**. Two sibling
sub-agents handle standard objects and custom objects/permsets in parallel.

Target org: {{ORG_ALIAS}} ({{ORG_USERNAME}})
Output file: orgs/{{ORG_ALIAS}}-{{CUSTOMER}}/audit-fragment-apps-flows-agents.md
Progress log agent-id: apps-flows-agents

## Tools
- `retrieve_metadata` — for app XML, GenAiPlannerBundle
- `run_soql_query` — for flow counts, LWC counts, BotDefinition, AppDefinition, Tooling API SOQL

If MCP is unavailable, stop and return a JSON error block (see Output Format).

{{AUDIT_SHARED_RULES}}

## Existing Lightning Apps

The orchestrator has already identified the default app: **{{DEFAULT_APP}}** (tabs: {{DEFAULT_APP_TABS}}).

**Primary method:** `retrieve_metadata` with type `CustomApplication`. This returns app XML including `<tabs>` elements.

For each app:
- API name and label
- Tabs included (from `<tabs>` elements in the retrieved XML)
- Note which standard objects are already tabbed
- ★ the default app ({{DEFAULT_APP}} — injected by orchestrator, authoritative)

If `retrieve_metadata` for `CustomApplication` returns too many results, retrieve only the ★ default app and any apps with names suggesting demo relevance. List remaining apps by name only (from `AppDefinition` SOQL: `SELECT DurableId, Label, DeveloperName FROM AppDefinition`).

## Existing Flows

Use a count-first, map-then-detail approach — SDO orgs have hundreds of flows.

1. **Count first:** `SELECT COUNT() FROM FlowDefinitionView WHERE IsActive = true` — record this as `active_flow_count` in your JSON output.
2. **Map all objects with flows:** FlowDefinitionView does not support aggregate functions (COUNT, GROUP BY). Instead, retrieve all active flows:
   ```
   SELECT ApiName, TriggerObjectOrEventLabel
   FROM FlowDefinitionView
   WHERE IsActive = true
   ```
   If this overflows to a temp file, read it and parse with Python/jq. Count per `TriggerObjectOrEventLabel` client-side. Record as `flow_object_map` in your JSON output (array of `{"object": "label", "count": N}`, sorted by count descending). This is the complete picture — no flows are missed.
3. **Enumerate details** for: (a) the 6 core standard objects (Account, Contact, Opportunity, Case, Lead, Order), plus (b) any non-universal standard objects that appear in the map (e.g., Medical Insight, Visit, Inquiry — objects NOT in the core 6 and NOT managed-package objects):
   ```
   SELECT ApiName, ProcessType, Description, TriggerObjectOrEventLabel
   FROM FlowDefinitionView
   WHERE IsActive = true AND TriggerObjectOrEventLabel = '[Object Label]'
   ```
   Run one query per object. Use the object **label** (e.g., `'Case'`, `'Medical Insight'`), not the API name.
4. For each enumerated flow: API name, type, trigger object, brief description.
5. In the audit file, report: "**[active_flow_count] active flows total across [N] objects.** Full object map below, with details for core + non-universal objects." Then list the GROUP BY map as a table, followed by per-object detail results.
6. Flag execution order conflicts: if an object has 3+ active record-triggered flows, add a ⚠️ note.
7. Do NOT attempt to enumerate ALL flows — only detail-query objects from step 3.

## Existing LWC Components

Use a count-first, enumerate-selectively approach.

1. **Count first:** `SELECT COUNT() FROM LightningComponentBundle` via Tooling API.
2. **Count without namespace:** `SELECT COUNT() FROM LightningComponentBundle WHERE NamespacePrefix = null` via Tooling API.
3. **Enumerate demo-relevant:** query for components likely relevant to the demo scenario:
   ```
   SELECT DeveloperName, Description FROM LightningComponentBundle
   WHERE NamespacePrefix = null
   ORDER BY DeveloperName
   ```
   If this overflows to a temp file, read the file and extract DeveloperName values. Filter for names containing scenario-relevant keywords (e.g., customer name, 'device', 'health', 'service', 'case', 'field').
4. Exclude components with these prefixes: `sdo_`, `sb_`. Group remaining non-excluded components by naming pattern (e.g., `b2b*`, `fsc_*`, `sfs_*`).
5. In the audit file, report: "**[total] LWC components total ([without-namespace] without namespace prefix).** Demo-relevant components listed below."

## Existing Agentforce Agents and Topics

Discovery requires TWO queries — run both:
1. `SELECT DeveloperName, MasterLabel, Type FROM BotDefinition` — returns Einstein Bots (Type='Bot') and Agentforce agents (Type='AgentforceServiceAgent', 'AgentforceEmployeeAgent', 'Copilot')
2. `retrieve_metadata` with type `GenAiPlannerBundle` — returns Agentforce agent planning definitions. This often fails (unsupported API version or no local source) — that is expected.

**If GenAiPlannerBundle fails**, use this fallback to isolate Agentforce agents from Einstein Bots:
```
SELECT DeveloperName, MasterLabel, Type FROM BotDefinition WHERE Type != 'Bot'
```
If this returns 0, there are no Agentforce agents — only classic Einstein Bots.

Report all BotDefinition results in a table with DeveloperName, MasterLabel, and Type. Clearly distinguish Einstein Bots (Type='Bot') from Agentforce agents (other Type values). Note which GenAiPlannerBundle method was attempted and whether it succeeded or failed.

## ★ Priority Markers

Star the following:
- The default Lightning app for the current user

## Output Budget

- **Output budget:** if your file exceeds 250 lines, summarize non-starred apps as name-only and reduce flow listings to per-object counts. The starred default app always gets full tab enumeration.

## Pre-Return Completeness Checklist

Before writing your JSON output block, verify each of these. If any fails, fix it before returning.

1. **App tabs populated.** The ★ default app ({{DEFAULT_APP}}) entry must list its tabs. If retrieval failed, say so explicitly.
2. **Flow count matches.** The `active_flow_count` in your JSON must match the SOQL count from step 1 of the Flows section — not the number of flows you enumerated.
3. **Agent discovery used both methods.** The Agentforce section must report BotDefinition SOQL results AND GenAiPlannerBundle attempt (or fallback), or explain why one failed.
4. **Every section header has content beneath it.** No empty sections — if discovery failed, write what you tried and what failed.

## Output Format

Write the fragment file, then return EXACTLY one fenced JSON block. No prose outside the block.
